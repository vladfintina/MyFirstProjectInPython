# MyFirstProjectInPython
A little project with CRUD operations I did all by myself while learning Python.

It is a console application whose purpose is to manage some products.
The user can add a new product, can delete it, can filter the products by name and price and there is also implemented the undo operation.

The application is divided in three important layers. The infrastructure layer which contains the repository, the business layer which has the service and the interface
layer whic contains the user interface.
